# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

## [1.0.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- support for yaya-1.0.0.0 and yaya-unsafe-1.0.0.0

### Changed

- Types, constructors, and functions no longer have an `F` suffix (for example, `TipF` is now `Tip`). The expectation is that if both this and the `containers` identifiers of the same name are needed in the same module, qualified imports should be used.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- support for GHC 9.12 and 9.14
- `verify-no-recursion` Cabal flag for auditing recursion usage by the library
- CPP conditionalization on containers-0.8 for `IntMap` & `IntSet` support – if you want to use those types on both GHC 9.14 and earlier versions, you’ll likely need similar conditionalization

### Changed

- license from “AGPL-3.0-or-later” to “AGPL-3.0-only WITH
  Universal-FOSS-exception-1.0 OR LicenseRef-commercial”
